==============
 New Features
==============
** If we add a file by going to folder of the project, it automatically gets included/excluded from the solution explorer, no need to use
"include in project" option.
===================
 About CSProj File
===================
** Go to csproj file, the targetframework talks about the framework in which we are developing the application.
** AspNetCoreHostingModel denotes how should we be hosting out application. It can be InProcess and OutOfProcess.
   InProcess hosts the app inside of the IIS worker process. OutOfProcess hosting means we will forward t=web requests to a backend ASP.Net Core app running the Kestrel server.
===================
About Package
===================
** Metapackage has no conetent of its own, i ts a bundle of various other packages. example: microsoft.AspNetCore.App
=================
InProcessHosting
=================
To check if its inproces or outprocess check the csproj file and ASPNETCOREHOSTINGMODEL tag, when its set to inprocess UseIIS will be called and if IIS Express is getting used then iisexpress.exe will kick in if IIS 
is getting used then w3wp.exe will kick in.
With InProcess hosting, we have just one server but in out of process hosting we have multiple servers, so firstly request goes to internal server (Kestrel) and then it goes to external web server.
Kestrel - Cross platform web server for ASp.Net core. Kestrel is provided by default by in ASP.Net core application, but since we run our applcaiiton from Visual Studio, we can see the process as IIS express (which is proveided by VS),
but if we run the application directly from CLI we will see the output as 'dotnet' (this is the hosting exe provided by kestrel).
With out of process web hosting we have 2 servers internal as well as external servers. internal server will be Kestreal and external web server will be IIS or apache or Nginx.
